Example session files to get you started with trm. These files are also available in the `examples/` directory of the [source repository](https://github.com/anthropics/trm).

## Basic: Single Terminal

The simplest possible setup -- a single terminal pane with default settings:

```toml
# trm.toml
[[panes]]
title = "Shell"
```

## Development Workflow

A 2x2 grid with an editor, dev server, test runner, and embedded preview:

```toml
title = "Dev Workflow"
rows = 2
cols = 2

[[panes]]
title = "Editor"
cwd = "~/projects/myapp"
watermark = "EDIT"

[[panes]]
title = "Server"
cwd = "~/projects/myapp"
initial_commands = ["npm run dev"]
watermark = "SRV"

[[panes]]
title = "Tests"
cwd = "~/projects/myapp"
initial_commands = ["cargo watch -x test"]
watermark = "TEST"

[[panes]]
type = "webview"
title = "Preview"
url = "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Multi-LLM Grid

A 3x3 grid running multiple LLM sessions simultaneously, with broadcast mode to send the same prompt to all:

```toml
title = "LLM Grid"
rows = 3
cols = 3

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 1"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 2"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 3"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 4"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 5"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 6"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 7"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 8"
initial_commands = ["claude"]

[[panes]]
title = "Claude 9"
initial_commands = ["claude"]
```

Use `Cmd+Shift+B` to enable broadcast mode and send the same prompt to all 9 instances at once.

## Plugin Gallery

Showcases multiple plugin types in a 2x3 grid:

```toml
title = "Plugin Gallery"
rows = 2

[[panes]]
type = "terminal"

[[panes]]
type = "webview"
title = "Docs"

[[panes]]

[[panes]]
type = "git_status"
title = "Git"
repo = "~/projects/myapp"

[[panes]]
type = "system_info"
title = "System"
```

```toml

[[panes]]

[[panes]]

```
