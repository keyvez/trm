trm supports 10 built-in pane plugin types managed by an extensible plugin registry. Each pane in the grid can be a different type, configured via `[[panes]]` blocks in your session file.

All plugins share these common fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | String | `"terminal"` | The plugin type identifier |
| `title` | String? | Auto-generated | Custom title for the pane's title bar |

## Plugin Registry

trm uses a plugin registry that maps plugin type names to factory functions. All 10 built-in plugins are registered at startup. The registry supports:

- **Plugin discovery** — list all available plugin types
- **Plugin instantiation** — create plugins by name
- **Extensibility** — future support for dynamic plugin loading

```toml
title = "Full Stack Dev"
rows = 2
cols = 3

[[panes]]
type = "terminal"
title = "Shell"
cwd = "~/projects/myapp"
watermark = "DEV"

[[panes]]
type = "terminal"
title = "Server"
initial_commands = ["npm run dev"]

[[panes]]
type = "webview"
title = "Preview"
url = "http://localhost:3000"

[[panes]]
type = "file_browser"
title = "Files"
path = "~/projects/myapp"

[[panes]]
type = "git_status"
title = "Git"
repo = "~/projects/myapp"

[[panes]]
type = "system_info"
title = "System"
```
